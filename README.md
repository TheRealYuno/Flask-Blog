# Actual legit 100% awesome Flask test blog

Alright my friends and foes, I created the greatest thing ever to be published on GitHub. A blog site in Flask. Nobody ever thought it could be done but here it is. It doesn't even use SQL, because it's simply too good for it.

## Requirements

Just flask. You don't need any extra stuff. Though if you take this project seriously and actually use it, I feel bad for you.
